# Systematic-Investing
All scripts used for the systematic investing channel will be posted here.  The goal is for everyone to be able to contribute; inexperienced programmers can plug and play and lend computing power while learning, and more experienced programmers can post their own versions and adaptations.  I hope that together as a community we can develop new and more accurate indicators, increase our collective knowledge of financial programming and trading, and above all make insane profits!  
Best of luck!
